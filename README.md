# Quant Terminal

A free trading terminal that runs on your own computer: charts, 87 indicators, 13 drawing tools, alerts, a screener, a heatmap, seasonals, earnings and dividend calendars, news, company financials, a strategy tester with quant checks, bar replay and paper trading. No account, no subscription, no ads, no limit on indicators per chart.

It's one small Node.js app with no dependencies. Your watchlists, drawings, alerts and paper account are plain files in the `data` folder, on your machine.

This repository is a fork of [LewisWJackson/quant-terminal](https://github.com/LewisWJackson/quant-terminal). The upstream MIT licence and copyright notices are retained.

## Install

**By hand.**

1. Install Node.js 18 or newer from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) (the LTS version is fine).
2. Get the code: `git clone https://github.com/theAfricanQuant/quant-terminal.git`, or download the ZIP from GitHub and unzip it.
3. In the `quant-terminal` folder, run:

```bash
node scripts/check.js
```

```bash
node scripts/launch.js
```

There's no `npm install` step. Next time, double-click `start.command` (Mac), `start.bat` (Windows) or run `./start.sh` (Linux).

## Where the data comes from

All free and public, with automatic fallbacks:

| Market | Sources | Limits |
|---|---|---|
| Crypto | Binance, then Binance's market-data mirror, Binance.US, Coinbase, Kraken | Live. If Binance is blocked where you are, Coinbase and Kraken take over |
| US stocks, ETFs, NDX | Yahoo when reachable, Nasdaq's public API | About 10 years of daily history. Intraday history is today's session only unless Yahoo is reachable |
| Forex | Yahoo, then Kraken | Kraken gives the last 720 bars per timeframe |
| Indices, futures, non-US stocks | Yahoo (type `YAHOO:^FTSE`, `YAHOO:GC=F`, `YAHOO:VOD.L`) | Only when Yahoo isn't rate limiting your connection |
| Economic calendar | Forex Factory's weekly feed | This week only |

`npm run doctor` tells you which sources work from your connection.

## Your own indicators

Each custom indicator is a JavaScript file in `custom/`. This one is included as an example:

```js
export default {
  name: 'EMA ribbon squeeze',
  overlay: true,
  inputs: [{ key: 'fast', label: 'Fast EMA', type: 'int', default: 8 }, { key: 'slow', label: 'Slow EMA', type: 'int', default: 34 }],
  outputs: [{ key: 'fast', label: 'Fast', kind: 'line', color: '#26a69a' }, { key: 'slow', label: 'Slow', kind: 'line', color: '#ef5350' }],
  calc(bars, p, ta) {
    const close = ta.source(bars, 'close');
    return { fast: ta.ema(close, p.fast), slow: ta.ema(close, p.slow) };
  },
};
```

`ta` has `sma, ema, rma, wma, hma, rsi, atr, stdev, highest, lowest, crossover, crossunder, source` and `compute(id, bars, params)` for any built-in indicator. Return `markers` to put arrows or labels on the chart.

## Strategy format

The tester, alerts and screener share one rule format, so an AI agent can write strategies for you:

```json
{
  "indicators": { "fast": { "id": "ema", "params": { "length": 9 } }, "slow": { "id": "ema", "params": { "length": 21 } } },
  "entryLong": [{ "left": "fast", "op": "crossesAbove", "right": "slow" }],
  "exitLong": [{ "left": "fast", "op": "crossesBelow", "right": "slow" }],
  "stopLossPct": 5, "feePct": 0.1, "slippagePct": 0.05
}
```

Entry conditions must all be true. Exits need all of theirs too, unless you set `"exitMatch": "any"` to exit on whichever one fires first. `"maxBarsInTrade": 10` closes a trade after 10 bars if nothing else has.

`"spreadPct"` is the bid to ask spread: buys fill at the ask, sells at the bid, and stops trigger on that side (the tester's Live spread button reads it from Binance, Coinbase or Kraken). `"intrabar"` sets how stops and targets fill inside a bar: `"worst"` (stop first when a bar touches both, the default), `"ohlc"` (TradingView's path: open, the nearer of high and low, the other, close) or `"magnifier"` (the real lower-timeframe bars inside each bar, like TradingView's bar magnifier).

Operators: `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `crossesAbove`, `crossesBelow`, `crosses`. Operands: a number, a price field (`close`, `high`, `hl2`...), an indicator key, or `key.output` such as `macd.signal`. Signals use a bar's close and fill at the next bar's open.

A backtest shows how rules did on past prices. It doesn't tell you whether the result was luck.

## Optional local PTQ connection

If you already run PTQ on the same computer (`ptq serve`), Quant Terminal finds it automatically:

- **Check with PTQ** appears under every strategy tester result. It sends the rules to PTQ, which backtests them on its own engine and checks whether the result was luck: walk-forward, overfitting (PBO), deflated Sharpe and higher costs. The strategy is saved in your PTQ.
- **The PTQ tab** shows your PTQ account, positions, armed strategies and recent orders, with a button that stops all PTQ trading.
- **Trading it** happens in PTQ. Connect your account in PTQ, then arm the strategy on the command line (`ptq arm-strategy <id> --max-notional 100`). PTQ shows what you're agreeing to before anything trades.

Quant Terminal never sees your PTQ licence key or your exchange keys, never places an order and never arms a strategy. It can only make PTQ do less: engage its stop, or disarm a strategy. It reads the lease `ptq activate` saved on this computer and talks to PTQ on `127.0.0.1:8787` (set `PTQ_URL` to change that). PTQ's builder takes SMA, EMA, RSI, ATR, ROC, standard deviation, Bollinger Bands, MACD, Donchian highs and lows and volume; anything else is refused with the reason rather than approximated.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm start` | Start and open your browser (http://localhost:3777, or the next free port) |
| `npm run serve` | Start without opening a browser |
| `npm run doctor` | Check Node and which data sources you can reach |
| `npm test` | Offline tests (indicators, backtester, server) |
| `npm run smoke` | Start the server and check it serves live data |
| `PTQ_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787 npm start` | Point the PTQ connector somewhere else |
| `npm run compare -- BTCUSDT 1D 2026-10-10` | Print indicator values for one bar, to check against another charting tool |

`PORT=4000 npm start` picks a port. `HOST=0.0.0.0 npm start` lets a phone on your home network open it (only do that on a network you trust).

## Limits

- It runs on your computer. Close the laptop and alerts stop.
- No broker connection. Paper trading only, on purpose.
- Free data: crypto is strong, US stocks are daily-first, and non-US markets depend on Yahoo.
- No social feed, no mobile app, no cloud sync.
- This build is for one trusted computer. Do not expose its server to the public internet as-is; shared state and custom-indicator, alert and webhook routes need isolation and access controls first.
